[Figure 1] 
In [figure 1] you see an example of me trying to install Linux to the kernel, but the 4.9 Linux is already on the kernel. The command I used to install and application on the kernel is apt install [application]. I made the mistake of entering in apt install linux-source-[old version], also made a mistake of putting an s at the end of essential.  
 
[Figure 2] 
When I figured out if and which Linux version was installed on the hardware I was operating I used cd Linux-source-4.9 to change to that directory. Showen in [figure 2].  
  
 
[Figure 3] 
When I ran into trouble trying to cd to Linux, I was instructed to us ln –s /usr.src/linux-source-4.9 to try and move the files in linux to the user so I could change to Linux dir. (at least that what I think I did). [Figure 3] shows how I tried to extract the compressed files from Linux source 4.9 I used the tar –xvf linux-source.tar.bz2.   
 
 
[Figure 4] 
[Figure 4] shows the timedatectl command. A mistake I made timedatectl command was trying to execute this command in a Virtual Machine environment. The problem with this is that the virtual box does not have an internal clock to track your work. I was instructed to just use the command date for this environment.

I could not figure out why my USB could not take the image for the Beta elive. I made the mistake of using .img instead of .iso
