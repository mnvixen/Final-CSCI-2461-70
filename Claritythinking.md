CSCI 2461 
 
This report was first intended for National Aeronautics and Space Administration, scientist, and Engineers. In recent times this report is used worldwide. When you are finding the meaning, or trying to sow clarity in your paper can be challenging. Although this is not the actual course, here are some pointed I got from this reading.  
Basic Attitude 
When explaining something in your writing try to use word that your reader can best understand, without having to look up the definition. You have to keep in mind the most people are busy and give a limited amount of time to things that are reading. 
Honesty 
When discussing your experiment or findings, try not to steer away the reader from any faults or failed results. The reader can then admire you for your honesty and learn from your mistakes. If the readers have to shift through your work to find that results or information is an accurate, this may cause your reader to uninterested in your report.  
Shadow Boxing 
 When writing, try to stay true to your word without adding others opinions or quotes they might have said.  
Cler Thoughts, Clearly Expressed Words 
In your reports try to use words that will not confuse the reader. For research papers might sure to use scientific words. Stay away from using lingo used in office and laboratory settings.  
Sentences 
Each of your sentences should be 35 words or less. Make sure that your sentences correlate with each other. All sentences should support the main idea of the paragraph. Sentences leads people step by step through your writing.  
Paragraph  
To make a good paragraph all of the sentences must flow and make sense. You should clarify the relationship of each paragraph to your research in the beginning sentences. Paragraphs should be smaller to give your reader the less chance of being confused. 
Organization of a Technical Report 
There is no set way for writing a technical report. But some key things to discuss are stating the problem, describing your approach, showing results, and summarizing thesis and conclusion.  
Introduction 
This piece of your writing should tell the readers the background information, the problem, and what this issue means to you.  
Apparatus and Test  
Having the appropriate apparatus and good insight to your procedures will give you more creditability. Let your reader now how older your equipment is. 
Result and Discussion 
When presenting your results, you can discuss them later, or you can throughout your paper. Try to have main points that will manifest in your results and discussions.  
Chapter Heading  
Specific titles are more favorable in your technical reports.   
Tables, Charts, and Figures 
Instead of using tables to present your results. Try using curves and charts. This will allow your readers to better understand your material.  
Summary  
Create your summaries to be straight to the point and easy to read. Describe what you learned with little background history.
