Introduction 
 
The beginning  
Human computers were the first mainframes for earlier computation mathematics. Launching astronauts into space, creating software and mastering applications, changing the way we communicate with the world. I will start my research in the year, September, 1969. This is when UNIX started its first journeys. Five to six years later the new innovation to the Unix systems were able to share working stations and provide essentials tools to programmers. In the 21st Century teleology has grown to the IoE (Internet of Everything). Vast networking and tons of memory types has let the Unix system live on to it later innovations as Unico's 1.0, and Trusted Unico 8.0.  
October 29, 1962 the first data travelled between 2 nodes on the ARPANET. The ARPANET has created a lot of the network protocols. During this era the very first radical idea of networking computers came about. In 1969 Ken Thomas developed the first game " Space Travel". This gamming program was first executed using Multics then later transliterated into Fortran for GECOS. Bill Duvall and Charley Kline, were two young programmers who discovered Unix. The earliest version of Unix was called Cira. Cira ran on digital equipment corporation PDP- 7 and computers. PDP- 7 became operational February 1971. The PDP allowed programmers to formations of applications and text based information. The early goal of Unix was to be affordable in terms of manpower and equipment. They only wanted to spend $40,000 or less and 2-man years that was spent on main system software.  
In 1977 PWB was created! This application provided time-sharing working environments for larger groups and programmers. PWB allowed for programmers to utilize tools to manage their source codes, while collaborating on labs and projects with other collogues. In April 1981, there was 2,500 Unix systems places around the world. The latest Unix version in 1981 was TS 4.0.1. In 1982 The U.S. department of justice allowed AT&T to enter as a computer business. This allowed AT&T to sell the Unix system commercially, leading to a telephone companies. The first commercial version was call System 111, which did not include a source code. In the article The Unix Programming Environment, by Brain W. K and John R. M. They write about creating a productive Unix environment, that is also cheap, and its techniques can spread widely. The Unix System V Release 2 came out in 1984. February 1st 1996 Kenneth R, Richard P. R., and James M. F. published Unix System V Release 4.  
                                     Conclusion 
The Unix system is very complex operating, that evolved greatly over the last few decades. I researched and examined just a small portion of the many evolutions of this program. It all started, in the basement of a couple of very smart young men, who wanted to challenge the technology field.
